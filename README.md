# Minesweeper-React-App
An attempt at Minesweeper as a phone app

### React Native

## Installation instructions

You can use whatever tools you want, but I use npm and am currently using an Android emulator on Windows. These are more notes for myself than *the right way* to get this to run.

### Preconditions
- Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) "installed"
   - unzip and set up as a path variable
- Have an emulator set up and running (just install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio))

From the root directory run the following commands
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 ```
 npm run android
 ```
